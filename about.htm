	<div class="block">
		<p>My name is <span>Abhay Raj</span>, and I am a resident of Shantipuram in Prayagraj, although my hometown is Patna, Bihar. I come from a family of four members, with my father, <span>Mr. Shailendra Kumar Sinha</span>, being a dedicated government employee serving as the Station Superintendent at Phaphamau Junction. Our family relies on my father's income as our primary source of sustenance and resources.<br><br>
		In terms of education, I am currently pursuing my <span>B.Tech</span> degree in the <span>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</span> branch. I am currently in my 6th semester at <span>United College of Engineering & Research</span> in Allahabad. So far, I have maintained a commendable academic record with an aggregate of 77% marks until the 4th semester. My secondary education was completed through the CBSE Board, where I achieved an impressive 88% in high school and 76% in my intermediate examinations.<br><br>
		My aspirations extend beyond academic achievements, as I aim to secure a position in a reputable organization that will help me fulfill my goals. These goals primarily revolve around providing financial support to my family and applying my theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. I consider myself a diligent and hardworking individual, firmly believing in the power of consistency and perseverance.<br><br>
		Furthermore, I am eager to expand my skill set and embrace new opportunities for personal and professional growth. With a passion for learning, I am committed to staying updated with the latest advancements in my field and actively seeking avenues where I can contribute effectively.
